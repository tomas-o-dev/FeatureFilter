# ChiMerge Algorithm
# 1. sorting continuous features
# 2. make each example as one interval
# 3. compute chi2 value for every pair of adjacent two intervals
# 4. merge certain pair of intervals that have lowest chi2 value
# 5. go 3 until chi2 values from all pairs exceed threshold of 
#    pre-defined significance level (until all alternative hypothesises become passed)
